# Cat-and-Dog-classification
In this project I used CNN model to perform binary classification on the dog and cat dataset.
A three layered Convolutional model was used to classify dogs and cats from the cats and dogs dataset using stochastic gradient descent as the optimiser and an accuracy of 64%.
